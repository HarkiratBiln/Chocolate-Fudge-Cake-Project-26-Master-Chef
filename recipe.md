This is the Recipe of the Chocolate Fudge Cake:


1. Preheat oven to 150C or 300F. Grease a 22cm cake pan and line with   baking paper. 

2. Melt butter and chocolate: Place butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Microwave 3 x 30 seconds on high, mix in between, until melted. Mix.

3. Add oil, vanilla and sugar, mix to combine (this brings down batter temp).

4. Add eggs and mix until combined.

5. Dry Ingredients: Sift cocoa, baking powder and flour directly into the bowl. Mix until smooth, batter will be thin. Some small lumps is ok.

6. Add hot water. Mix until incorporated.

7. Pour into the cake tin and bake for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out moist but clean. Check at 50 minutes. The surface will crack (sometimes badly!) but sill subside when it cools and gets covered with frosting so don't stress!

8. Remove sides from the cake pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Cool completely before carefully handling to remove base (Note 7)
